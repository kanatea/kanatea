### Hi there!

Iâ€™m a BA/MS student in Applied Social Research at Hunter College.

- I'm currently learning research methodology that applies Machine Learning in the social sciences
- Iâ€™m interested in exploring digital disinformation, voter disenfranchisement, and unequal ad distribution 
- Iâ€™m currently looking for projects that incorporate ML methodology in policy research, specifically in the context of surveillance and criminal justice
- I go by she/her pronouns
- I love to read, my current favorites are Twitter & Teargas and The House On Mango Street

I believe in spreading and sharing the wealth of knowledge! Please reach out to me via email.
