### Hi there!

I’m currently an MS student in Geospatial Technologies/Geoinformatics at NOVA IMS, Lisboa.
I have a MS in Applied Social Research from Hunter College, New York.

- I'm currently learning data mining methodologies in GIS and geoinformatics, including machine learning and neural networks
- I’m interested in exploring digital disinformation, voter disenfranchisement, and data accessibility
- I would like to continue working in public health or social science research
- I’m currently looking for projects that incorporate ML methodology in policy research, either in the context of surveillance and criminal justice or in epidemiology (ideally a combination of both)
- I go by she/her pronouns
- I love to read, my current favorites are [Twitter & Teargas](https://twitterandteargas.org) and [The House On Mango Street](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_House_on_Mango_Street)

I believe in spreading and sharing the wealth of knowledge! Please reach out to me via email.
